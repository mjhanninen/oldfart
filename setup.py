"""
Oldfart is a HTTP server that can generate requested resources on-demand
using `make(1)` on the background.

You might want to use Oldfart as a development server. It would fit especially
well if you're already using `make(1)` to build your project the artifacts of
which are eventually served as static resources over HTTP.
